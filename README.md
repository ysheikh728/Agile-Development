# ðŸŽ¯ **Agile Development: From Theory to Practice**

## ðŸ“– **Introduction**

Embark on an Agile journey, moving from foundational concepts to hands-on application. While the task â€” creating a "Hello Professor" web page â€” might seem elementary, it encapsulates the essence of modern software development. Through this assignment, you'll gain hands-on experience and a deep understanding of Agile methodologies, tools, and principles.

## Note about Final Individual Project

This assignment is the basis for both your final individual and group project.  I will be creating new repo for them; howeveer, you will have to implement all of this for both projects.  For your individaul project you will need to design and implemnt your own portfolio using this process and for your group projedt, you will need to take your mid-term analyis and implemnt it like this project as well.  There will be two features that both projects need to implement; however, I will include this in those projects.  The features are relativly simple, one feature is to add Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with GDPR privacy protection and the other featuree is that you have to add a SAAS service such as Mailchimp or HubSpot that will be the conversion objective of the site i.e. what you want the user to do such as signup for your newsletter or something like that.

Each of the modules has a series of tasks and each tasks needs to have a GitHub issue added to the GitHub project board and tracked through completion.  Some tasks require writing user stories and/or acceptance critera and this should be inlcuded as part of the task issue that you create and add to the project.
