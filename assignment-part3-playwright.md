# **Technical Feature 2: Playwright Integration**

## 📌 **Overview**

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is an end-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft that allows you to automate browser actions, facilitating testing web applications across multiple browsers. Incorporating Playwright can significantly improve code quality by ensuring features and functionalities work as intended in different environments. It plays an essential role in the modern DevOps and Agile practices, where continuous integration and continuous delivery necessitate automated testing.

Why use Playwright?
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit).
- **Reliability**: Eliminate flaky tests with auto-waiting for elements.
- **Rich Automation**: Interact with web elements, intercept network requests, and more.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Incorporate Playwright for automated project testing.
