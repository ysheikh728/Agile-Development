# **Developer Document: Web Page "Hello Professor"**

## ðŸ“Œ **Introduction**

This document serves as a guide for the design and development of a web page titled "Hello Professor." The aim is to create a welcoming and engaging web page, ensuring alignment with design mockups and predefined user stories.
Figma serves as a bridge between the conceptual phase and the coding phase. By providing a clear visual representation via Figma mockups, we reduce potential misunderstandings, ensuring efficient development cycles.

## ðŸ“Œ **Epic: Web Page Implementation**

**Objective**: You are creating a "feature packet" that will be provided to the developer i.e. YOU that explains what needs done and what the final product should look like. Develop a web page with the title "Hello Professor" and an `h1` title displayed prominently.

### **Acceptance Criteria for Epic**:
1. The web page is accessible via the correct URL.
2. Both title and `h1` are visible on the page and align with Figma mockups.
3. The web page passes all predefined Playwright tests.
